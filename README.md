# First-Three-Characters-of-a-String

write a Python program to print the first three characters of a string step by step.

Input: Keyboard

Output: Key

Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to write a program that reads a single line of input and prints the first three characters in it.

Step 2: Get the string from the user
First, let's ask the user to enter a string. We'll use the input() function to get the value.
Now we have the string as a string data type.

Step 3: Get the first three characters
We can get the first three characters of the string using string slicing in Python. 
In the above line of code, message[:3] means we are selecting the substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) the 3rd character.

Step 4: Print the result
Finally, we'll print the first three characters of the string using the print() function.
